# RFM Segmentation and CLV Calculation for E-commerce Dataset


## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive Python data analysis exercise, showcasing skills in data manipulation, visualization, and interpretation. The analysis is performed on a customer dataset, addressing specific questions related to customer behavior, segmentation, and lifetime value.

## Files
1. **[Data_Analysis.ipynb](Data_Analysis.ipynb):** Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the data analysis tasks.
2. **[Dataset Folder](Dataset):** Contains the dataset used for analysis.

## Instructions
Follow the steps below to review the analysis:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ghaskari/RFMSegmentationCLVCalculationforE-commerceDataset.git
```

### 2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
Open `Data_Analysis.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment. Alternatively, use online platforms like Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook Viewer.

### 3. Run the Code
Execute code cells in the notebook to perform data analysis tasks.

### 4. Review Results
Check the notebook for calculated metrics, visualizations, and answers to provided questions.

## Questions and Answers

### 1. Calculate Metrics for Each Month of 1398 (Persian Calendar)
- Number of Customers
- Number of Orders
- Total Revenue
- Average Order Value
- Average Frequency

### 2. Identify the Month with the Highest Order and Revenue
Determine and print the month with the highest number of orders and total revenue.

### 3. Segment Customers Based on RFM Model Using K-means
Analyze customer segments using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model and K-means clustering. Visualizations are provided.

### 4. Calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for Customers Joined in Farvardin (Bonus)
Estimate CLV for customers who joined in Farvardin, assuming a 365-day churn period.

## Note
- Assumptions and specific details for each question are included in the code.
- Persian calendar months are used for analysis.
- K-means is used for customer segmentation based on RFM model.
- CLV calculation considers churned customers and the number churned rate.

## Requirements
